This is my favorite class.
This is the repository of Martin Hummel.

I am going to use Python Markdown in this class. Markdown is great.

The class is at CBS.

We are going to learn:

How digital organizations work.
What modern types of organizations exist.
Present in the browser.
We are also pretending we are developers, because:

we use the CLI.
we will make a presentation in the browser.
we are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
we learn about the GitHub workflow.
